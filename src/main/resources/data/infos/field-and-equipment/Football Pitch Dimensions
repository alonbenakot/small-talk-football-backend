            "text": "Soccer fields come in different sizes, but there are some basic guidelines to keep things consistent. A professional soccer field is typically 100 to 130 yards long and 50 to 100 yards wide. You can picture it like a giant rectangle where all the action happens. In youth soccer or grassroots levels, though, the fields shrink a bit to accommodate the little guys. The idea is to keep the game fun and manageable for all ages. Whether you're playing in a local park or at a big-time stadium, the key is that the size of the field suits the skill level of the players on it.",

            "text": "When it comes to football pitches, size does matter, but it’s all about what’s appropriate for the level of play. A standard professional pitch is between 90 to 120 meters in length and 45 to 90 meters in width, giving plenty of space for both intricate passing and crunching tackles. For grassroots and youth football, the pitch is smaller to match the players’ capabilities, ensuring the game remains enjoyable and competitive. While there’s a bit of flexibility in pitch sizes, the key is consistency at each level of the game. Whether it’s Wembley or a local park, the football pitch is where magic unfolds, regardless of its dimensions.",
