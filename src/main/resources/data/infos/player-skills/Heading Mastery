            "text": "Heading the ball is like making a slam dunk—just with your head instead of your hands. Whether you're in defense or attack, winning those aerial duels is key. When defending, think of yourself as the goalie in basketball—jump early, time your leap, and clear the ball with authority. On offense, aim your header like a basketball shot—get power from your neck and shoulders, and direct the ball toward the goal. Practice positioning too; you’ll need to be in the right spot at the right time. With some practice, you’ll be turning those high-flying chances into goals and shutting down threats from the sky.",

Defensively, it’s all about timing—rise above your opponent and get a solid connection to send the ball away from danger. Offensively, a well-placed header can be just as effective as a powerful shot—direct your header with purpose, using your forehead to guide the ball. Positioning is crucial too—get yourself into the right spot, and you’ll be first to the ball in those aerial duels. Master the art of heading, and you'll be a force to be reckoned with, both at the back and up front.",
