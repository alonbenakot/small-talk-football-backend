            "text": "VAR, or Video Assistant Referee, is soccer’s high-tech referee assistant, like having an instant replay booth right on the field. When a play is too close to call – was that a goal, a foul, or was someone offside? – the ref can pause the game and consult the VAR team. These folks review video footage from multiple angles and help the ref make the right call. It sounds like a win for fairness, but it hasn’t come without controversy. Fans love it when it works in their favor but hate the long delays and sometimes, even with video, the decisions are still debatable. Like it or not, VAR is here to stay, keeping the game in check – most of the time.",

            "text": "VAR, or Video Assistant Referee, is football’s modern answer to getting those tricky decisions spot-on, or at least trying to. When the ref isn’t quite sure about a handball, offside, or a dodgy tackle, they can stop the game and consult VAR. A team of officials reviews video footage to help the ref either confirm or overturn the original decision. While it’s meant to bring more accuracy, VAR has stirred up its fair share of controversy, with long pauses in the game and sometimes baffling outcomes even after the footage is reviewed. Some say it’s taken the spontaneity out of football, while others feel it’s added a layer of much-needed justice. Love it or loathe it, VAR is now part of the beautiful game.",
