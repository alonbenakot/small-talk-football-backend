These sharp-eyed sideline spotters help the ref by signaling when the ball’s gone out of bounds, but their main gig is making those all-important offside calls. With their trusty flags in hand, they raise them to alert the ref when a sneaky forward has strayed too far ahead of the last defender. It's a thankless job – often stirring up more debate than celebration – but without them, the game would be a chaotic, offside-free frenzy. Together with the ref, they ensure the game runs smoothly, like the perfect supporting cast.",
