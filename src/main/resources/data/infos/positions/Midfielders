They play a pivotal role in connecting defense with attack, using their vision and passing skills to control the game’s tempo. Central midfielders typically act as the team's playmakers, distributing the ball and orchestrating moves from the middle of the pitch. Defensive midfielders, or holding midfielders, are the unsung heroes, breaking up opposition attacks and shielding the backline. Meanwhile, attacking midfielders, or playmakers, focus on creating scoring opportunities with clever passes and creative flair. Essentially, midfielders are the team’s dynamic link, balancing defensive responsibilities with the creative drive needed to ignite an attack.",
