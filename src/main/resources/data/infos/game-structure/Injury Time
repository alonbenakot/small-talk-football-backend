            "text": "Injury time is like a mini-drama within the match, as the game pauses to handle injuries and make necessary substitutions. When a player goes down with an injury, the referee stops the clock, allowing medical staff to rush onto the field and assess the situation. Depending on the severity, the injured player might need to be substituted, and the team can bring in a replacement, which can also be a tactical decision. During these pauses, the referee adds the time lost to injury time at the end of each half, so the game’s flow isn’t completely disrupted. This period is crucial for ensuring player safety and maintaining the game’s integrity. Injury time helps balance the scales, ensuring that the match continues fairly despite the interruptions",
