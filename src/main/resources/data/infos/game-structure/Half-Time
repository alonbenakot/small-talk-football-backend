This 15-minute break is crucial for players to rest, rehydrate, and get a quick pep talk from their coach. Teams use this time to analyze the first half, adjust tactics, and make any necessary substitutions to change the game’s momentum. It’s also a moment for players to refuel, grab a snack, and get any minor injuries attended to. The half-time break can be a game-changer, as it often sets the stage for tactical shifts and fresh bursts of energy in the second half. Essentially, it’s a crucial intermission that can turn the tide of the match and set the tone for the remainder of the game.",
